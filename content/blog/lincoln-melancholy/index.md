## My admiration for Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln is widely regarded as one of the greatest presidents in America's history. I first gained an appreciation for him afer reading Team of Rivals by Doris Kearns Goodwin. Learning about how he handled conflict with the people around him and found ways to get people to work together for the common good was inspiring. I grew to admire him so much that we named our youngest son after him.

In dealing with difficult or frustrating people, Lincoln would sometimes take time to write out a response to them and get his frustrations out in writing. He would then put the letter away and wait several days before sending it, allowing himself to get some distance from the conflict. I've taken that and implemented a similar strategy. Sometimes just the act of writing it out allows me to gain some perspective on the situation and realize that I don't need to be as frustrated. It also gets my own thoughts out of my head so they stop looping through my thought process.

## Lincoln's struggle with depression

Most people aren't fully aware that he struggled with depression for most of his adult life. Despite this struggle, he was able to accomplish great things in his life. That isn't to say that his depression didn't overcome him at times. There were moments in his life when he gave in to the depression and was rendered incapacitated for a time. But these experiences helped form him as a person.

This quote was the most inspring for me:

> Whatever greatness Lincoln achieved cannot be explained as a triumph over personal suffering. Rather, it must be accounted for as an outgrowth of the same system that produced that suffering. This is not a story of transformation but one of integration. Lincoln didnâ€™t do great work because he solved the problem of his melancholy. The problem of his melancholy was all the more fuel for the fire of his great work.

As someone who struggles with depression, I have come to realize that it isn't something that can be overcome. It is a constant battle, with some days being easier than others. All I can do is acknowledge it is there and continue forward each day. It is about taking what we have and making the best of the situation.
